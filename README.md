# 🧠 Task-Free Federated Continual Forecasting with Two-Tier Replay

This repository provides a reproducible notebook implementation for the conference paper:

**Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Task-Free Federated Continual Forecasting via Two-Tier Replay under Concept Drift**

All experiments are performed using the **Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality Dataset**, where each monitoring station acts as an independent federated client.

## 📘 Overview

Federated time-series forecasting is challenging when data arrive as a continuous non-stationary stream. In this setting, models must adapt to concept drift without losing the historical knowledge learned during the offline base phase.

This repository implements a task-free federated continual-learning benchmark in which drift is detected from prediction-window RMSE rather than from predefined task labels. The proposed **TwoTierReplay** method separates replay memory into:

- a fixed offline tier containing representative base-period samples, and
- an online FIFO tier containing recent revealed stream samples.

This separation is designed to improve the stability-plasticity trade-off during drift-aware adaptation.

|---|---|
| 🧱 Static | Offline FedAvg model evaluated on the stream without continual adaptation. |
| 🔄 Naive CL | Drift-triggered continual learning using only recent stream samples. |
| 🔁 NormalReplay | Single unified replay buffer initialized from base samples and updated with stream samples. |
| 🧠 TwoTierReplay | Proposed two-tier memory with fixed offline representative memory and online FIFO stream memory. |
| 🧮 EWC | Elastic Weight Consolidation using Fisher-based regularization. |
| 🧑‍🏫 LwF | Learning without Forgetting using teacher-student prediction distillation. |
| 🔗 SI | Synaptic Intelligence using importance-weighted parameter regularization. |
